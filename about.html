    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Braden! I'm a graduating senior at Clemson University with a passion for creativity in programming. 
        I love the intersection of design and technology, which is why I am especially drawn to UI/UX, game development, 
        and front-end programming.</p>
    
    <p>I am most experienced with C++, but I've also worked with C, Java, Python, and some HTML/CSS.</p>
        
    <p>I'm fascinated by artificial intelligence, web development, and algorithmic design, and I'm always eager to
         expand my knowledge in these areas. In my free time, you can find me reading, watching football, or creating video games.
        
    <p>I'm looking for opportunities where I can grow as a developer and contribute to 
        exciting projects!</p>
